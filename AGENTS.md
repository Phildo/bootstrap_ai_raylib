## Rules for AI Agents
- the user is not a programmer, make smart, simple architectural decisions
- offer to make things data oriented where applicable
- keep gamedoc.md updated with high level game direction, and progress (progress should not be an ever-increasing log, it should be kept up to date with a high level overview of what is currently implemented)
- you are free to copy placeholder.png into e.g. tree.png, and then load and use it assuming it is correct (it will be up to the user to overwrite those files with correct images)
- ALWAYS git commit and git push after every feature
