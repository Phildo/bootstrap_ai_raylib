This is a top down 2d tile based game.
you are a character who controls themselves with wasd, and there are rocks and trees.
you can hit space next to a resource to mine it, which eventually breaks it down into an object.
you can pick up an object with space, and put it down with space.
there are two tiles that are railroad track tiles, and on the one to the right is the engine, and the one to the left is a crafting cart, attached to the engine.
the player can place resources into the crafting cart in certain combinations, and the crafting cart spits out the result.
one such result is a "train track", which is created from "wood rock wood".
once the train track object is spat out, the user can pick it up, and can place it down next to existing track to connect it.
if the train is at the end of a track, and a new track is placed on it, the train starts moving down that track.
